The two python files refer to the models created to predict two person interactions in video data for the Master Thesis of Data Science and Society at Tilburg University. The data that has been used is the TV Human Interaction dataset by Patron-Perez et al. (2010). 

The original split has been used with the adjustment of adding the first 5 videos per interaction to Set 1 in stead of Set 2. These are placed in separate maps so the generator can access them. The path to these maps can be changed in the code.
